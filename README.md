# Mazer

A fun little maze based game where the player has to navigate their way around a maze making sure to visit every blank space on the game board in order to complete a level. The player can only choose their direction and then they will travel forward continuously until a wall or edge stops them, this is where the challenging element of the game comes stems from. 

My main reason for writing the game was as part of a learning exercise to teach myself about object-oriented structure.
